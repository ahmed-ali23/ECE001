            In our daily needs, a smartphone also becomes the 4th necessity for the human along with dress, food & shelter. 
            If you are using a smartphone, it indirectly means that you are enjoying the AI by knowingly or unknowingly. 
            Design the methods for automation by using learning and perception have become a common phenomenon in our everyday lives. 
            We have our lady Siri for iOS devices or Cortana for Windows devices to help us out. 
            We also prefer the help from GPS for the long drives and trips. 
            A smartphone is one of the apt everyday examples of how we utilize the power of AI to reduce the barriers in a day to day life. 
            In the part of utilities, we can find that how they predict what we are going to type and provide the suggestion to correct the human errors in spelling. That is one of the most used machine intelligence at work irrespective of industries and freelancers. 
            While coming to the social media users based utilities, the artificial intelligence algorithm identifies and detects the person’s face and tags the individuals while we post the photographs on the social media sites. 
            AI is widely deployed and utilized by the financial institutions and banking sectors to organize and manage data. Detection Of Fraud uses one of the best advantages of an artificial intelligence involvement in the smartcard-based system transactions

            Highly advanced organizations already implemented machines on behalf of humans to interact with their customers by using ‘avatars’. It is the digital assistants or replicas which will help to reduce the need for human resources. 
For AI Machines, emotions only can be identified in the way of rational thinking. 
Robots can’t identify the sentimental factor of the user. It actually programmed for only think logically and take the right program decisions based on the existing experience taught to the machine. 
Emotions can’t be identifying by the machines that may be dissatisfying the customer. In that case, we need human intervention. This lagging tries to rule out for machine intelligence. But still, it helps in other aspects.

            Repeated jobs are tedious in nature. That kind of jobs can be easily handled with the help of AI algorithms. These kinds of job don’t require much intelligence in between the process. 
Machines can think much faster than humans and can perform multi-tasking to obtain the best results. 
Machine intelligence can be employed to carry out dangerous tasks which may cause injury to the human involved in that. Their parameters can be adjusted is the benefit here. Their speed and time can be customized based on the requirement calculation. 
Whenever human operates the machine-like playing a game or run a computer-controlled robot, it means that we are actually interacting with AI Machines. 
In the computer game, the machine itself plays the game like as an opponent based on our activity in the game. The machine plans its movement based on the user response. So, we can say gaming is one of the most common uses of the advantages of artificial intelligence.

            One of the great advantages of Artificial Intelligence is utilized in the field of medicine. We can identify the numerous numbers of medical applications which rely on AI. 
Doctors/Physician assesses the patient’s health-related data and intimates the risk factors to the customers via the health care devices with the help of artificial machine intelligence. 
It helps the patient to know about the side effects of different medicines and also behaves as personal digital care. Artificial surgery simulator is the great innovation part of the AI. The efficiency of that always prefers to utilize that simulator by the Professionals for the treatment. 
Currently, we have huge software to detect as well as monitor the neurological disorders. It can simulate the functionality of the human brain. 
Robotics is used often in the treatment for mentally sick patients to come out from their depression also make them remain active in the real world. 
The current medical industry has the popular application of artificial intelligence is Radiosurgery. It helps us to operate the tumors without damaging the unaffected surrounding tissues.

            Artificial Intelligence and the science of robotics are the fascinating advancements in technological development. Using this, we can able to handle the huge volume of data for storing and processing but not limited to as well as we can use that in the process of mining and other fuel exploration processes.
These complex machines can be utilized to overcome human limitations. We can utilize these machines as a replacement for the humans wherever we felt the process done by the human is hazardous but can’t neglect that because of the goodness or results received.
They can perform difficult tasks and accurate work with greater responsibility without any lag. Moreover, they do not wear out easily.

            The advantage of using Artificial Intelligence is, it helps us for error reduction and increasing the chance of reaching higher accuracy with a greater degree of precision. 
It can be applied in various situations including the process called exploration of space. 
In that intelligent robots are fed with information because of the velocity of the data creation. Such kind of information forwarded to explore the space. Even though those are machines with metal bodies, those are the most resistant in nature also it has a great character which can help us to abide by the space and unfriendly atmosphere. Because of that, they used to create and acclimatize. It cannot be modified unknowingly or can’t get disfigured or breakdown in a hostile environment. In this scenario, we can’t neglect anything, by handling this we need to address this issue with the efficient solution like Artificial Intelligence.

            Privacy is a basic human right that everyone deserves. However, Artificial Intelligence may lead to a loss of privacy in the future. Even today, it is possible to track you easily as you go about your day. Latest technologies like facial recognition can find you out in a crowd and all security cameras are equipped with it. The data gathering abilities of AI also mean that a timeline of your daily activities can be created by accessing your data from various social networking sites. 

In fact, China is currently working on a Social Credit System that will be powered by Artificial Intelligence. This system will give all Chineses citizens a score based on how they behave. This may include behavior like defaulting on loans, playing loud music on trains, smoking in non-smoking areas, playing too many video games, etc. And having a low score may mean a ban on travel, having a lower social status, etc. This is a prime example of how Artificial Intelligence can lead to access in all parts of life and total loss of privacy.

            Autonomous Weapons

        <i>
        Autonomous weapons or “killer robots” are military robots that can search their targets and aim independently according to pre-programmed instructions. And almost all technically advanced countries in the world are developing these robots. In fact, a senior executive in a Chinese Defense firm even stated that future wars would not be fought by humans and that using lethal autonomous weapons was inevitable.

But there are many dangers in having these weapons. What if they go rogue and kill innocent people. Or even more tragically, what if they cannot distinguish between their targets and innocent people and kill them by mistake. Then who would be responsible for that situation? An even bigger problem would be if these “killer robots” are developed by governments that don’t care about human life. Destroying these robots would be pretty difficult then! Keeping these problems in mind, it was decided in 2018 that autonomous robots would still have to take a final command from a human in order to attack. But this problem could increase exponentially with the increase of technology in the future.

    Loss of Human Jobs</h2>
    <p
    style="font-size: x-large;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;text-align: center;">

    <i>
    As Artificial Intelligence becomes more and more advanced, it will obviously take over jobs that were once performed by humans. According to a report published by the McKinsey Global Institute, around 800 million jobs could be lost worldwide because of automation by 2030. But then the question arises “What about the humans that are left unemployed because of this?” Well, some people believe that many jobs will also be created because of Artificial Intelligence and that may balance the scales a bit. People could move from physical and repetitive jobs to jobs that actually require creative and strategic thinking. And people could also get more time to spend with their friends and family with less physically demanding jobs.

But this is more likely to happen to people who are already educated and fall in the richer bracket. This might increase the gap between the rich and poor even further. If robots are employed in the workforce, this means that they don’t need to be paid like human employees. So the owners of AI-driven companies will make all the profits and get richer while the humans who were replaced will get even poorer. So a new societal setup will have to be generated so that all human beings are able to earn money even in this scenario.

Lacks Creativity</h2>
<p
style="font-size: x-large;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;text-align: center;">
<i>
    As already mentioned above – AIs are not built for creative pieces of work. So, it should be crystal clear by now that creativity or imagination is not the forte of the AIs. Although they can help you in designing and creating something special, they still can’t compete with the human brain. Their creativity is limited to the creative ability of the person who programs and commands them.

Human brains are characterized by immense sensitivity and high emotional quotient. To put it simply, AIs can become skilled machines but they can never acquire the abilities of the human brain. The reason is that skills can be learned and mastered, but abilities come naturally and can only be honed.

    Lack of ethics
</h2>
<p
    style="font-size: x-large;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;text-align: center;">
<i>
    Morality or fairness measurable for a machine is hard to design and convey. AI can hardly be taught what is right unless the engineers provided this concept.
The cost-benefit approach will remain the most reliable for robots when they need to estimate a specific situation.
To prevent disastrous outcomes, we need to realize the relevance of ethical principles.
